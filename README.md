Inspiro is your personal inspiration companion, designed to uplift your mood and provide tailored suggestions for each moment.

Imagine this: You upload a selfie and share how you feel. Our app then analyzes your mood, age, race, and mental state using Sky Biometry's API. With this information, Inspiro generates personalized suggestions and even delivers a lighthearted joke to brighten your day.

On top of that, We integrate the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information based on your location. This ensures that our suggestions, like taking a short walk in sunny weather or staying cozy indoors on a rainy day, are perfectly tailored to your environment and mood.

We also connect with the Bored API to offer unexpected yet exciting suggestions that match your interests, adding an element of surprise and adventure to your day.

Inspiro isn't just about providing ideas; it's about enhancing your well-being and encouraging you to seize the moment. With geolocation capabilities, we even recommend nearby activities based on your availability, making it easier for you to engage in the suggested activities.

In a fast-paced world, Inspiro stands out as a tool for mindfulness, productivity, and fun. Its potential for growth and impact is significant, offering users a simple yet powerful way to enrich their daily lives.

Join us on this journey of self-discovery and inspiration with Inspiro. Thank you!
